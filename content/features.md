# features

- All [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- File based routing
- Add an optional header and footer to all pages
- Add an optional stylesheet

Does that list seem short? Good. That's the idea. If it takes you longer to
figure out how to use this thing than it does to write your own SSG then I
failed.

No templating. No automatic aggregation of links on pages. No themes.

Based on the premise that curation is valuable, so you'll need to manually
organize and link your pages. It's really not that hard with a decent text
editor.
