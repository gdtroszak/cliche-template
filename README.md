# cliche-template

Template for a [cliche](https://github.com/gdtroszak/cliche) site. Fork it to start your own.

This template is setup to deploy to GitHub Pages, but you can tweak it to deploy
the built asset to whatever hosting provider you like.

## GitHub Pages settings

If you're going to deploy to GitHub Pages, ensure the settings in your site
repository look like those in the screenshot below.

1. Make sure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions".
2. If you're using a custom domain, enter that as well.
